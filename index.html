        <p>I am a seasoned Information Security professional with experience in
          building robust control environments. I have experience designing and
          implementing security solutions for external clients,as well as building
          security programs from scratch both as an Information Security Manager
          and as a Director of Information security.I hold certifications in varried
          topics such as ethical hacking, vulnerability management, security
          monitoring, threat intelligence, attack emulation, process improvement,
          and more. With my combined experience and education I feel there are few
          topics within security I cannot be a resource on </p>
